# Automated Decomission Scripts

Two Python scripts that I created to help automate some of the steps requried during the decomission of firewalls.

The scripts iterate through provided CSV files that contain a large number of firewalls and carry out checks against each firewall before returning the results to the user in a seperate CSV file that lets the user know the results of each check.
